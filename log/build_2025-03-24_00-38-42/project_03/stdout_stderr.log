[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findendicott_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "endicott_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "endicott_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    endicott_interfacesConfig.cmake
    endicott_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "endicott_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "endicott_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "endicott_interfaces" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
